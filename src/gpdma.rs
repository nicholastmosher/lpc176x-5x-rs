Restarting the channel by setting the Channel Enable bit has unpredictable effects, the channel must be fully re-initialized. The channel is also disabled, and Channel Enable bit cleared, when the last LLI is reached, the DMA transfer is completed, or if a channel error is encountered. If a channel must be disabled without losing data in the FIFO, the Halt bit must be set so that further DMA requests are ignored.

This causes the current AHB transfer (if one is in progress) to complete and the channel is then disabled. Any data in the FIFO of the relevant channel is lost. Restarting the channel by setting the Channel Enable bit has unpredictable effects, the channel must be fully re-initialized. The channel is also disabled, and Channel Enable bit cleared, when the last LLI is reached, the DMA transfer is completed, or if a channel error is encountered. If a channel must be disabled without losing data in the FIFO, the Halt bit must be set so that further DMA requests are ignored.
